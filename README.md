Marble is a simple console program demonstrating PRNGs. Marble teams are denoted by different colors. Their population drops as the rounds progress. When every team dies out or the game script ends, the last team standing wins.

## 🎉 Features  
**Customizable rounds**
- Add/set/multiply a team's population
- Multiple built-in presets

## 🛠 Building

I use Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10, though most IDEs can compile Marble.
